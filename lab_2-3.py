# Create a Python file named lab_2-3.py

# Set a equal to 2. Using the type() function, print the type of variable a
a = 2
print(type(a))
print(a)
#a is a integer
# Change the type of a to a float using a = float(a). What is the result of printing type(a) now?
a = float(a)
print(type(a))
print(a)
#a is now a float
# Convert a to a string. Check its type with a print statement. What has changed?
a = str(a)
print(type(a))
print(a)
#a is now a string
# Convert a to a Boolean. Print the result of a == 2. What is the result? Why? (Answer as a comment)
a = bool(a)
print(a == 2)
print(type(a))
print(a)
# the result is false becuse we are compareing the intiger 2  to the bool a and becuse they are difrent formats they are not the same
